title = 'From Engineer to Architect: The Muscle Groups That Change'
+++

Over the last couple of years I've been slowly relabelling myself (career wise) from being a Data Engineer that did a bit of architecture to really focusing on the Data and Solution Architecture roles. In the last couple of months especially I've really noticed a change in how I think about it. From being a change just in seniority or title, it's really about looking at everything through a very different lens. Today I want to take a closer look through that lens and highlight the real differences I'm noticing. For example, it's not just about diving in and fixing problems, it's more about understanding the real issue and looking at the risks, and the timescale that things happen in.

**Let me just fix it**
Stuff happens. Things break. Performance starts to go backwards. These are all things that happen. From a pure Data Engineering perspective, I'd try and fix everything as soon as possible. Patch this part of the stack, refactor this process or shove more resources at something. These are all the things we do in the moment, when looking at the issue. Most of these are the right thing at the time, but as you go through it you sometimes realise that all we are doing it just putting lipstick on a pig.

As I've started focusing more on architecture, I'm realising that sometimes if we take a step back and look at the bigger picture, maybe that small fix isn't the answer. Maybe that pipeline isn't used anymore and could be deprecated. Maybe the instances in the cluster are the wrong type, or there something better now. Maybe the whole platform needs to be revisted. It's that pause to look at the solution in it's entirity, rather than the rush to fix the issue in isolation, that separates teh archtiect from the engineer.




Opener
	•	Realisation that the shift wasn’t about seniority or title
	•	Discomfort of not jumping in to fix things anymore
	•	Feeling slower at first, then realising it was a different kind of speed

⸻

Muscles That Shrink

The “Let Me Just Fix It” Reflex
	•	Engineer instinct to patch, refactor, optimise immediately
	•	Architectural pause instead of action
	•	Choosing not to spend energy on local fixes that hide systemic problems

⸻

Tool Obsession
	•	Knowing platforms deeply vs mistaking that knowledge for good decisions
	•	Tools as constraints multipliers, not solutions
	•	Being right about the tech and wrong about everything else

⸻

Being the Smartest Person in the Room
	•	Visibility used to equal value
	•	Architecture success often invisible
	•	Quiet success looks like nothing happening

⸻

Muscles That Grow

Question Framing
	•	Shifting from answering questions to rewriting them
	•	Focusing on decisions, not features
	•	Clarifying what problem is actually being solved

⸻

Tolerance for Ambiguity
	•	Making calls without complete information
	•	Accepting “least bad” options
	•	Sitting in uncertainty longer than is comfortable

⸻

Systems Thinking
	•	Seeing incentives, ownership, funding, governance as part of the system
	•	Understanding why “bad” designs often make sense locally
	•	Optimising across time, not teams

⸻

Writing Things Down
	•	Decisions, assumptions, trade-offs
	•	Creating organisational memory
	•	Protecting future teams from past amnesia

⸻

Saying No Without Blocking
	•	Framing consequences instead of opinions
	•	Making trade-offs explicit
	•	Letting others make informed decisions, even if you disagree

⸻

The Ongoing Tension
	•	Still wanting to build
	•	Still caring about quality
	•	Learning when not to intervene

⸻

Close
	•	Not less technical, just less reactive
	•	Architecture as long-term risk management, not diagram production
	•	Progress measured in fewer surprises, not more features

⸻
